# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a DataFrame that summarizes the ride sharing data by city type and then create a line graph that shows all three types of cities on one chart with respect to the weekly fares between January and April.

## Results

As you can see with the DataFrame pictured above we can see that the place with the most ride shares will be the Urban type of city witht the most amount of drivers, but with that the rural drivers have a better chance of getting more money as the average fare per ride is much higher due to the face that their are less of them. It seems to show that the more densely populated city areas are harder to make money and have shorter drives on average.

## Summary
Based on these results I can say that maybe decreasing the amount of money per ride in the rural area will increase the amount of rides as that is highly skewed compared to the other city types, also finding the weeks where peopke ride the most per city type and offering ride deals may help even out the data per city type, and adding more incentives to the rural cities to use the rideshare could also increase the market in that city type.
